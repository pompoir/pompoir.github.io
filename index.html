							<section>
							
								<p>When you're out walking the dog every day, you get a feeling for where you're allowed to bring pets in.  Local hardware stores have a tendency to be dog-friendly, so I've slowly gravitated towards doing more of my shopping there.  This led an impromptu purchase of a circular saw, which required a project to justify the purchase.</p>
								<p>I decided to embrace adulthood and get my mattress up off the floor.  Poking around YouTube led me to a design that seemed manageable, with the creator hosting detailed design schematics on their Instructables page.  I had to make a couple changes, adapting a King configuration down to a Queen and nesting the mattress into the bed rather than having it sit precariously on top.  I couldn't figure out AutoCAD software quickly enough, so I threw together some hand-drawn plans to get a feel for what supplies were needed.</p>
								<p>To get away from the sawdust, the dog and I headed down to the hardware store to grab the metal brackets that will support the middle of the mattress and the slatted boards that hold everything in place.  No need for these to be fancy, they'll be hidden from view when the job is complete.  In fact, no hardware at all is visible  on the final build due to using pocket holes, which are best understood by looking at how we assemble the headboard.
									I want to show off an unobstructed view of that natural wood, but it's imperative that the headboard be sturdy.  Pocket screws are a solution that work alongside a drill jig that makes precise guide holes to securely attach boards at extreme angles.  This ensures the screws hit the strong core of the next board and form a secure, covert connection.
									I've also used this strategy to connect the outer shell of the bed, and even just a couple of screws along a six foot long board yields enough strength to stand on without sag.
									With the headboard and outer shell framed up, were on to the finishing touches of the blueprints.  We'll construct the support structure that runs down the middle and use it to mount bracing boards secured to either side.  This design is extremely robust and eliminates the need for a box spring, which keeps the whole thing low-profile.
									The bed needs a final varnish to lock in the wood's lustre and protect it against moisture, but I haven't settled on which product to go with yet.  I'm also not looking forward to dragging the whole thing outside to air out the varnish fumes, so stay tuned for a final picture after I've thrown a couple coats on!

												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>Oh, okay well, it's a confusing movie in a variety of ways, but there's a scene early on that I was watching it as a kid, which again, the movie is not for kids. So that explained why I didn't understand part of it. The main character is a doctor, and at one point, like, after, I don't know, a stressful day, he goes home and in his medicine cabinet he has marijuana, and he, like, rolls it up and smokes marijuana with his wife, and as a kid I was, like, that doesn't make any sense. He's a doctor. Like, why would he smoke drugs? And that was, like, the part of the movie that I took issue with even though there's a million other weird things that happened. But as a kid, I was, like, nope. Doesn't add up. You can't be healthy and smoke at the same time.</td>

It's just like the older we get, the more we tolerate, like, grey. If we were all, like, as as rigid as kids sometimes, we'd all probably be healthier.</td>

I just thought, like, it doesn't make any sense that this guy would get home from work and then chain smoke 7 cigarettes in a row because that's the way I perceived what he was doing.</td>

												<tr>
													<td>Joe</td>
													<td>Oh, yes; I love this era.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>Well, we're not gonna be there for too long. So before there were 50 United States, there were 13 British colonies. There were these settlements along the East Coast of North America. There were originally only 12, but they split one of them in half, and now we have North and South Carolina. So today's story is a shout out to North Carolina, home of the Green Swamp. Now they call it a swamp, but it's really a lot more than that. It's a bog, savannah, subtropical wetland. Basically, it's this huge 16,000 acre state protected nature preserve, and this conservation -</td>

													<td>Joe</td>
													<td>Wow, I didn't know about that. It's amazing.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>Well, it's still there. And the the conservation area I guess what makes it interesting to me is this conservation area and the 50 mile radius that extends around it is the only place in the world that a very strange plant grows. Any guesses before we get into the -</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Jasper</td>
													<td>Oh, yeah.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Joe</td>
													<td>Can you give us, like, a kingdom hint? Or I guess you gave us kingdom. Can you give us, like, genus?</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Jasper</td>
													<td>Hold on.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>I mean, I have, like, the the technical name for it but I don't know how - </td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Joe</td>
													<td>Is it, k. It's a bog?</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>It's a bog grower. And, actually, bog growing plants are a breed, a specific breed. But</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Joe</td>
													<td>is it perennial? Does it, like, reoccur? It's, like, one shot?</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>Yeah. It's it's been growing in the swamp, I suppose, forever.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Joe</td>
													<td>Does it have notable flowers?</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>Yes. I would say extremely notable. Or no. Sorry, sorry. Extremely notable leaves, the flowers are sort of unremarkable.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Joe</td>
													<td>No. I have no idea. I have no idea. I have no clue. Is, like, only average.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>That's okay. Well, rather than get bogged down on that, let's just go back to 1759 when the colonial governor of North Carolina sent a series of letters back to his botanist friend in England. In them he went into detail about this unusual plant. I'll paraphrase. He said, It's a dwarf plant with leaves of 2 parts. Anything that falls between the leaves is instantly closed on like a fox trap. To this surprising plant, I've given the name Fly Trap Sensitive.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Jasper</td>
													<td>Venus fly.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>So, much like the 13 colonies, we moved on to a new name. And what were you saying there? I think you had it.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Joe</td>
													<td>Oh. Venus fly.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>This is the Venus flytrap. This is the first Europe had ever heard of the Venus flytrap. Now, as you can imagine, Native Americans had figured it out way earlier. They called it titipwetchit or Leaves Which Wind Around. </td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Joe</td>
													<td>Good name.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>Seems like no matter who you ask, everyone brings attention to the foxtrap leaves. So today's episode artwork is a look inside that trap, which is easiest to understand if you look at it like an open jaw, a mouth that's ready to snap. So as you can see they've got I think that's a bee, in there.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>Yellow jacket.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Joe</td>
													<td>No. That's a that's a buzzer. That's a bee, I think. Actually, no. You're right. Your apiology is better than mine, too.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>It's not a honey bee.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>Nope. That's, some kind of Bospor, ain't it?</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>It's a winged insect. Let's agree well, we can agree on that.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Name</td>
													<td>Okay.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>So like I said, we're looking at the inside of the trap. So these are the leaves of the trap. Now you'll have to zoom in to go a little closer to take a look. But if you look, it the inside is filled with these little hinged hairs.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Name</td>
													<td>Oh, yeah.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>And they break inward if disturbed. So if you touch only one of them, nothing happens. But if you touch another within 20 seconds the trap triggers and the prey is captured.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Name</td>
													<td>Wow.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>So now once these walls have closed in and the mouth has shut onto the victim, it actually has a little light at the under end of the tunnel, little gaps. If you look at sort of the outer edges of the leaves, they weave closed but if you were small enough you could still wriggle out from in there. And that's actually on purpose because they want to be sure that the thing that they've caught is worth the effort that it takes to digest. It's the same reason why it takes 2 triggers to set off the trap. They don't wanna waste their time trapping a raindrop or a leaf or anything that is going to create a caloric deficit once the digestion is over. So picture the small hairs like a security system, and it's one that basically is able to ignore false alarms. But in this video that this picture is taken from, the bug does walk around, it does hit a couple of hairs, and it does get snapped in on. And, once you get snapped in on, the the bug panics and walks around trying to find a way out. And on the way through, they're triggering a bunch more hairs. And once we get to 5 total, you've confirmed for the plant that you are a big moving item and then the walls shut completely. It forms a hermetic seal and jasmonic acid, releases digestive enzymes and they eat the prey over the course of about 10 days.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Name</td>
													<td>Actually though, wow.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Name</td>
													<td>Can you use the term eat? Is it technically eating? </td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>Well, I mean, it's very similar to the way that you eat, you know, digestive acids that break it down and absorb it into the plant. So yeah, I mean - </td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Name</td>
													<td>I see a, I see a mouth and teeth if I'm being honest. Yeah. Only one chew though. Imagine that. You only need one chew. Boom.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Name</td>
													<td>Is there a an attractive scent or odor that drives these?</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>That's exactly right. Scent. Yeah. The the very tips that you can see. Joe, you referred them to, like, teeth, but actually, although that makes sense for the mouth, metaphor, they actually feel more like eyelashes. So for instance, you can stick your finger in there and it's not gonna hurt you if it close on you. They're not sharp. But, yes, Jasper, they are covered with an attractive, oil and or or something that it brings the bugs culture to it.</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Name</td>
													<td>Some like, like pseudo-nectar. The bugs are like "this would be good back at the hive".</td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>That's right. And and it's only when the plant is quite developed, but they also actually make normal looking flowers as well. So between the 2, they get a good amount of traffic.</td>

													<td>Yeah. I mean, like, I think they're pretty base thinking. Right? They're, like, "hey, food!" and then it turns out the food was a trap. The detailed specifics of how a flytrap operates, that that wasn't covered in the letters back in 17/59. In fact, it was a 100 years later that a guy started publishing books about him.

													<td>So Darwin is known for his theory of evolution, and the Venus flytrap was one of his shining examples of what he was talking about. So to summarize his work, Darwin found that there were about 600 different plants that catch and devour insects, and they tend to occur in areas where the soil is low in nutrients, especially nitrogen. So that would be places like bogs. Carnivorous plants adapted to these harsh environments by getting their nutrients from dead bugs. Most of them function like fly paper. A lot of them are really basic. It's just a sticky surface that bugs land on and they can't get off of. Spider web quicksand kind of thing. There's only 2 plants that use the clamping mechanism that we were just describing, the flytrap, and it has an underwater cousin, the water wheel. I did not know that, but there's little water, flytraps as well.</td>

												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>Okay. So even rarer than being carnivorous is the ability to move quickly. This is a phenomenon that they named rapid plant movement. Not very creative on that one, but it's extremely rare to move quickly for a plant. And when it snaps its mouth shut, it does it in a tenth of a second. So that's pretty fast. But I learned that the white mulberry tree is way faster. Get this, it shoots pollen out at 600 kilometers an hour, which is half the speed of sound.</td>

And also, here's my explanation for why they work like that. Like, why not shut completely? Because it knows it's gonna waste its time if it catches something tiny. So it just lets tiny things go. Little things like that.</td>

And they have a bunch of theories as to why, like, the trap is always red and green as we can see. The flower is always white. So that's like a signal, something that can, like, wanna pollinate white flowers, but doesn't like red flowers. And then they also say that, most of the pollinators fly, whereas, typically, like, the vita flytrap will eat anything that jumps in it that's big enough as you said, but most of the things that jump in it according to National Geographic crawl up it. So, like or crawl onto it. So it's, like, typically, flying gives you a slight advantage. But as we can see, this bee is about to get mad.</td>

													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>So Right. So this one is a controlled environment. In the actual green swamp where the bug is happening, you're you're right to point that out. So the flytrap is a bit of a misnomer. Basically, it it doesn't eat very many flies. It eats mostly ants and spiders, beetles and grasshoppers a little bit less, and flying insects account for less than 5% of its diet. So flytrap is not the best name, and I think you're right to say that the crawling through the middle of it is what gets things, not the landing on the edges of it.</td>

Like you said before, the the plant doesn't make any decisions. Like, it's not like, I know what kind of bug this is, and that one isn't very good, so I won't close on it.

													<td>Yeah. And to clarify how it works even on a closer level is, basically, it's being held open. And so when the trigger hairs are triggered, it just stops holding on. It's like a mouse trap or like a foxtrot. Like, it's in a state of tension, and then the tension is removed and that's what makes it snap shut. But people still look at it at this plant and say, like, it's an intelligent plant.

													<td>Yeah. So basically the the summary of the movie is that an alien plant comes. I just wanna clarify that because I think people think that the plant in the movie is a Venus flytrap, and in the movie they describe it as like a Venus flytrap, but it is a talking alien, not a flytrap. So just to clarify. Because people seem to think, like, oh, it could eat a person because it eats people in the movie, But no, it can't. It can only eat small bugs. But after I watched it, I realized that there are a lot of, like, references to it in, pop culture that I didn't understand the reference, and now I do, from having seen it. But, anyway, I wouldn't really recommend it as a movie, to be honest. I didn't like it, but it won't eat you. Don't worry. The Venus flash hack won't eat you. And if you do stick your finger in there and trigger 2 of the things, like I said, it'll try to snapshot on you, but they're more like eyelashes than teeth. So it's not gonna hurt.

Right? That was the reason is some adult saw that movie and thought, can I buy one of those? And it turns out you can.

In 1993 they did an investigation and confirmed that the species was quote unquote in decline. Despite that, they did not take any further action until they opened another investigation 25 years later, so that was in 2018. So what did they decide in this verdict on the 2018 investigation? Well, hold on. These inquiries take time, usually more than a decade. The average is 12 years. The problem is that the Venus flytrap can't wait 12 years. I actually reached out to the US Fish and Wildlife, Service for more information, and they confirmed that the flytrap had been fast tracked and the initial verdict will be published by, quote unquote, fiscal year 2024. So I guess that means by the end of this year.

First off, we keep paving over them. In the 40 years where we lost 99% of traps, we doubled the number of humans in that area and more than doubled the number of roads.</td>

													<td>Yeah. And it has a a byproduct. 2nd, more humans means less wildfire. Now as strange as it sounds, the Venus flytrap actually likes wildfire and requires one to pass by every 5 years or so. Not because it specifically benefits them, but because they are relatively unharmed, whereas everything else is eradicated and the flytrap is left with free rein to expand. So less fires means not as much room to expand, and they don't have as high a population. 3rd</td>

													<td>Isn't that sick? That's, interestingly also true about to a somewhat different extent about red pines, like, the red pines around here. And I was paddling through, like, a burn zone in Quetico last summer and my mom was pointing out how, like, like, now because fires are less frequent because there's not controlled burns, like, indigenous people used to do that a lot or it would just happen. But when you have fires frequently, what ends up happening is the fires are less intense because there's less fuel basically that is accumulated. But when the fires happen less frequently, the fires get way hotter and, like, some of the trees that have evolved for frequent fires actually can't withstand the intensity of the really hot fires that come seldom or less frequently now. But where we had this map that we were using to go through the fire zone where it was like intensity levels on topography and so, like, where the fire had been less intense, you could see everything burned except the red pines were still chilling somehow, like, they were unaffected, like, there's so much sap which you think would burn but it like somehow strengthens their wood against fire. I don't know. There's probably a much better explanation here but, yeah. And then, like, some, trees like jack pines require fire to open their cones and that's like 30% of the biomass in the boreal forest. Right? So it's like, yeah. More fire, please. I didn't know the traps needed it though. That's cool. </td>

													<td>Okay. So Hey, John. We talked about the fact that we're paving over these, bogs. There's more people. That means less fire. So those are the two factors. The third one, and I think the most interesting, is poachers. Now harvesting fly traps on public land was made illegal in 1958 but it still happens. Basically, they go out in the swamp with a backpack and a machete, and they dig the plants up by the 1,000 and resell them on what is essentially a Venus flytrap black market. And I listened to an interview with Sergeant Dean who patrols the Green Swamp, and he said it's usually it's a tale all the time in the United States. It's usually felons who have trouble finding work elsewhere, and they can go load up their bags, you know. It's also sometimes a family business. They've got fathers and sons who just load up their pillowcases or backpacks and sell them on the black market for, like, 25¢ apiece. And so Sergeant Dean put out trail cameras hoping to catch some images of the culprits, and they just stole the trail cameras. So and the worst part about it is that poachers are attracted to the dense clusters of traps at the core of the plant rather than, like, the leggy offshoots. But when you cut the core out, you're dooming the surrounding plants to die because you're not pruning them sustainably. So it doubles the damage done. Not only have you taken it, but you've also killed all these other plants in the process. And for the longest time, it was met with a slap on the wrist. If you get caught doing this, you might get a fine for a couple $100, but, like, you were already making a couple $100 a day by digging them up, so it's just the cost of doing business. What's more interesting is the buyer. Like, who is buying all of these stolen plants? And so it turns out that the greenhouse scale producers, despite their best efforts, can't meet market demand. And so they actually have the right to purchase additional plants from, licensed private growers. And the thing is they're so desperate for inventory that they don't look that closely at this license paperwork, and they're incentivized to mix poached plants in with the ones that they have made. So they just mix in poached plants with their own crops for profit. Actually, one commercial seller, their name is Flychap Farms, they even went on record saying that they buy poached plants. Like, they had no problem admitting that that was the case. And they were also the subject to a burglary, where thieves made off with 18,000 plants stuffed into the store's own shopping bags. People in the industry saw this as a bit of a comeuppance because it's a fitting punishment for people who are willing to bend the rules. And I looked them up and they no longer exist. So company's done.</td>

They sold them to Jasper and they sell them to lots of people, but, you know, like, if we can make enough lettuce to go around, how come we can't make enough of this? Right? We're making them at the a massive scale, but yet they're all being bought. There's a buyer out there for every single flytrap made, which is kind of strange because I don't have one.

In fact, they say that they don't buy flytraps from North Carolina at all. But how is that possible? It's the only place that they grow, right? Well, it turns out that as the natural population declined 99%, Chinese clones have exploded. So there are factories making Venus Flytraps in China. Clones of them. And why would they do that?

It is the brainchild of doctor Helmut Koller who posited that the extract of Venus flytraps cure a variety of ailments. Now in some countries, they'll tell you that they cure cancer, but in the US, the FDA forbids them from making those claims. So instead, they call it a powerful immune defense supplement. </td>

													<td>So some of these claims are are correct and yet not approved by medical authorities, like, I'm a big proponent of reishi mushrooms, which occur here in grand great amounts, but, like, they also occur in China and they were, like, rare and forbidden for consumption, like, except by the the nobility and the emperor. And they were believed to extend life because they improve your circulation and a lot of other benefits, but they're called the mushroom of immortality. And then it turns out the ones here were, like, regularly consumed by indigenous people, for the same benefits. So it's like, you know, like, some of the things that we hear out of, like, eastern medicine and China, if you will, some of these things are, like, rooted in fact. They have an incredibly diverse, set of, like, plants growing there, obviously, really deep knowledge of mushrooms, like, old school. But it's shocking to me that the Venus flytrap doesn't even remotely occur in China, and yet it's, like, are they just serving a demand that's elsewhere or is this demand also coming from China? Because it's it would be shocking if, like, Chinese medicine is incorporating something that originated in the Americas. So Maybe yeah. Yeah. Ma'am, not maybe that always happens but what the hell?</td>

												<tr>
													<td>Sandy</td>
													<td>So China's not really making them for themselves. They're just making them at large scale so they can sell them to this company, Carnivora Research, who turns it into capsules. And, yeah, they have to buy from these factory scale Chinese producers because there aren't enough left of the real thing. And, Carnivore Research does sell products here in Canada, but they sell them for animals because animals have, less restrictions about what you can feed them. Because I'm horse paste. Exactly. So, yeah, you can get, you can get Venus flytrap extract for your pets if you, if you believe it to be a powerful immune defense supplement. But don't say it cures cancer. Gone now.

And a lot of carnivorous plants have died actually, like, and here's just, like, another I don't know if this is a fun fact. I was certainly surprised by this. I want you guys, don't look this up, estimate. Listeners at home, estimate how many plant species are on earth. Just throw out some guesses. What do you think?</td>

													<td>No. </td>
												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Name</td>
													<td>So it was like, it occasionally crept on to, primary and middle school reading lists in our, our early years. But in my opinion, John Wyndham's best book actually came out, I think, after that. It's called Day of the Triffids. But it really intersects nicely with this. Like, in Day of the Triffids, there's this guy and he's in hospital because he, got stung by a trifid, but through his face shield. And its poison only slightly impermanently blinded him. Now, a trifid is like this big huge plant that walks around. And, it doesn't always walk, like, it tends to chill, but it can like uproot itself and walk. It's about like 6 feet tall or even taller with like a kind of a like leaves, but it has like a big central vine with like a big flower thing on the top.</td>

												</tr>
												<tr>
													<td>Name</td>
													<td>Yeah. No. No bulb at the top. More like a big long kind of tall spear like thing, but it's more of a whip and the the the tip of it is like poisonous. And so, it can, like, oscillate itself and, like, whip people and if it, like, whips you and you're, like, not protected, you're you're toast. And it'll come in, like, I don't know if it eats you, I can't remember. But it turns out that these trifids, like, their oil, is like a kind of like a cure all. It's really good for health and</td>

													<td>Panacea.</td>

													<td>Name</td>
													<td>Like, make stuff out of it. And, so these trifids are cultivated everywhere. And this guy is, like, an expert expert at cultivating trifids. But he has this, like, industrial accident, goes to the hospital, and he's about to get out of the hospital. His eyes are almost better. And then, like, some strange astrological phenomena happens, or I guess, a astronomical phenomena. And there's, like, a meteor shower, And the meteors are green, and everybody's really excited. And they they go and watch it. The whole world watches it. But it turns out, if you watch this, you go blind. So, like, 99% of the world suddenly goes blind overnight. This guy, like, he, like, wakes up and peels the bandages off and he's, like, oh, shit. And then, like, the Triffids are just able to, like, run around and fucking annihilate everyone who's blind and get out of their compounds. And so he's it's basically, like, written in the fifties. It's one of these, like, original, like, zombie apocalypse books. But, it's like the plants are everywhere. And now that we're talking about it, it sounds like this guy knew all about Venus fly traps and why they were used. He almost predicted this except in his telling, the the flytrap was actually a worthy foe. That seems to be what everyone does. They take it one step further. One of the things that I really love about this book, I read it so many times as a kid, is, so like the trifids are like really hard to deal with. Like, you can't just like chop one up, like, they are really tough, like bamboo or like a really big hemp plant. And they are kind of smart, like, not smart in a human way like you described with plants, but like, you can't sneak up on one very easily. They've got like really ability to, like, sense movement through, like, these little hairs on them or something. And so, there's like this industry that's developed for trifid farmers and anybody who has land where trifids might be wild there because they're all over the world now, where it's like kind of like ninja tier weapons but like in an industrial age, they like chop them up. So there's like these guns that shoot like spinning saw blades and like these like hand slings that you can like use to like chop down the triphid from far away. And so like, as he's like trying to gather like, 1 or 2 people that aren't blind and, like, get the fuck out of dodge, they have to, like, stock up on, like, Trifid weaponry and it's, like, so so heavy metal, you know.</td>

I'm trying to remember, like, there's one scene that really stuck with me as a kid where it's like this guy, he's like, like hiding and, like, there's just chaos everywhere. And he sees, like, this blind man, like, break out of, like, I don't know, this, like, this, like, this woman, like, running with her kid and they're blind and this man comes and, like, beats them up and, like, injures them and steals the cans that they have, thinking it's, like, cans of food and he, like, gets away and then they get mauled by triphids and this guy's watching and he sees the man get to safety and he looks, and the man's got, like, 2 cans of paint. And he, like, does he hasn't opened the man. He's just, like, man, that guy's fucked. And he moves on. But I remember thinking about, like, the the horror and sorrow of that that whole moment. This guy, like, commits an unforgivable crime to survive and, like, can't see, and he's about to eat paint and then get mauled by triffids.</td>
